This repo contains a custom implementation of softmax regression (multiclass logistic regression) for the Digit Recognizer challenge on Kaggle.
Now, just to be clear, this isn’t the best-performing solution I’ve built. I’ve written a Convolutional Neural Network that pulls over 98% accuracy on MNIST.

But this one is built for clarity, structure, and simplicity. It’s a fully manual softmax model that still manages to hit around 90% accuracy (no libraries), just NumPy and solid code. It’s modular and clean.
